# Client Nginx Configuration
# This configuration is used to serve the static files of the React application
# It runs inside the client container and serves the built files on port 3000

server {
    listen 3000;  # Listen on port 3000 for incoming requests

    location / {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;  # Directory containing the built static files
        index index.html index.htm;   # Default files to serve when accessing the root path
        
        # This is crucial for React Router to work properly
        # It tries to serve the requested file, then falls back to index.html
        # This allows client-side routing to handle all routes
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
